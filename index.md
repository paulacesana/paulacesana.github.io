## Working Papers 

**Intergenerational Mobility in the Presence of Informal Labor Markets**

<div align="justify">
 
This paper explores intergenerational mobility in the context of Chile, an economy with an important informal labor market. I start by documenting two key empirical facts. First, labor informality is associated with higher income uncertainty, even after controlling for education and occupation. Second, an individual's labor informality is associated with their family background and, in particular, education and occupation intergenerational persistence account for a large portion of this association. Next, I propose a two-period model of human capital investment and occupation choice under uncertainty. In the model, greater income uncertainty reduces parental investment, leading to lower human capital in children, which increases the likelihood of informal work in the next generation. A counterfactual exercise shows that reducing parental income risk improves upward mobility and reduces informality. These findings underscore the role of income uncertainty in shaping future labor market outcomes and perpetuating barriers to intergenerational mobility. <br><br>

**Task Biased Technological Adoption Across Countries**  *with Giacomo Carlini*
<div align="justify">
 
This paper explores how differences in the adoption of task-biased technologies contribute to GDP gaps across countries. We introduce a country-specific measure of task intensity to quantify the relative importance of tasks within occupations, which can be readily applied in quantitative analysis. Using this measure, we show that as GDP increases, the share of routine work declines while cognitive work increases. Moreover, differences in task content within specific occupations explain more than half of the cross-country differences in routine work. We then develop a production framework where technology is task-specific, and occupations are aggregates of tasks, with which we rationalize both optimal task and occupational demands. We use this model to quantitatively assess the differences in task-biased technology adoption across countries and its implications for GDP gaps. Our main counterfactual exercise shows that closing the dispersion in task productivity adoption reduces the average GDP gap relative to the United States by around 25%. <br><br>

**Job Polarization and Occupational Mobility: Insights from Panel Data and Task Measures**
<div align="justify">
 
This paper examines the dynamic characteristics of job polarization in the United States, with a focus on different patterns of occupational mobility across demographic groups from the 1980s
onward. First, I categorize occupations into four broad groups and analyze occupation transitions using panel data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The results indicate that the groups
driving the growth in high-skilled occupations are not the same as those primarily affected by the decline in middle-skilled occupations. Second, using task information by occupation, I construct a Routine Task Intensity (RTI) index for each occupation, and examine its evolution across various demographic groups. A shift-share decomposition reveals that the within-group component plays a significant role in explaining the overall decline in RTI, particularly for
certain demographic groups. Overall, this paper shows that focusing solely on between-group occupational transitions is insufficient to fully capture the process of job polarization and
its full implications for different demographic groups. <br><br>
